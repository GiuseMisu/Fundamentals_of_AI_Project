# Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence Project

This repository contains the project for the "Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence" exam, part of the Computer Science and Automation Engineering program at Sapienza University.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Prolog**: Used for implementing AI-related logic and rule-based reasoning.

- **Python**: Utilized for various machine learning tasks.

- **Jupyter Notebook**: A popular environment for interactive data analysis and machine learning.

## Silvestri's Project

- **Description**: This project includes a Google Colab notebook where we analyze the "Online News Popularity Data Set" using various machine learning models to understand how the number of shares (the target variable) is influenced by various features.

## Project Umili Prolog

- **Description**: This folder contains a series of exercises related to programming in Prolog.
- **Folder**: [Project Umili Prolog](/Project%20Umili%20Prolog)

## Project Umili Research A Star

### Exercise 1 and 2

- **Description**: These exercises are designed to familiarize you with the gridworld environment.
- **Folder**: [Exercise 1 and 2](/Project%20Umili%20Research%20A%20Star/Exercise%201%20and%202)

### Homework

- **Description**: In the "homework" subfolder, you will find the implementation of an intelligent agent capable of moving in four directions within a grid world environment where not all cells are accessible. Specifically, after selecting the target cell to reach, the agent must:
  1. Find the optimal path to reach it if it exists.
  2. Follow that path.
